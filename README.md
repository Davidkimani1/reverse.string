A reverse string is when you take a sequence of characters and flip the order so the last character comes first and the first character comes last.

For example:

"hello" becomes "olleh"

"12345" becomes "54321"

"" (empty string) stays ""


Why it's done:
Reversing a string is a common beginner-level programming exercise because it forces you to understand:

How to work with strings and arrays,

How to manipulate data step by step, and

The concept of iteration or built-in methods like .split(), .reverse(), and .join().


How it works in simple steps:

1. Break the string into individual characters.
Example: "hello" → ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]


2. Flip the array around.
→ ["o", "l", "l", "e", "h"]


3. Combine the flipped characters back into a single string.
→ "olleh"



It’s basically like reading a word backwards.
